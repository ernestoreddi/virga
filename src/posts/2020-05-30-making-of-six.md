## Finding a new home for Sixty Six

@ 00:05 May 31, 2020{explanation}

I finally get to read ["Redesign: Clearing A Path"](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/redesign-wrapping-up/) by Frank Chimero. This post was the final note from his redesign journey.
Not only I love his design, I do also love what he writes. Reading these redesign notes got me think that it's time to find a new home for [Sixty Six](https://sixtysix.frontendweekly.tokyo/).

Virga was created for [Frontend Weekly Tokyo](https://frontendweekly.tokyo/). Not for Sixty Six. Moreover, Sixty Six is in an unique territory since it collects quotes.

That is why I'll create a new theme "Six" for Sixty Six. (I like naming stuff. Well, "Six" is not that difficult to come up, but I like it anyway.)

And this is where my journey begins.

This is a story about creating a theme for Eleventy, and I'll do it on open as Frank Chimero has done.

As always I don't know how this story going to end, but I'll document what happened to me along the way.

Notice the time stamp right after the header?
I think this journey will be long one, so I'm going to write this story open as well which means when I finished writing an "update", I'll make it public.
The time stamp indicates modification time.

## Blank. Not broken

@ 22:18 May 31, 2020{explanation}

I'm not a designer. I had once call myself one but not anymore.
I haven't done any development as a professional for long time either.
I definitely work around those area, but I'm not there.

Anyway.

Sixty Six has been distilled to blank state. Surprised to find out it is not broken. Surprised to see how simple Sixty Six is.
Which forces me to think about what Sixty Six is.

Here's what I have come up so far.

"Sixty Six is a collection of highlights which makes a foundation for the discoverable mental notes."

My english skill has been diminishing but I still can tell this isn't good one, but it is not broken.

What is the kernel of Sixty Six?

I'm not a designer. I may not be able to introduce myself as an engineer anymore, however I still love HTML and CSS. That has to account for something.

I'm nowhere close to answer the question.
I'll start with HTML to find a way in.

## My canvas

@ 23:17 June 3, 2020{explanation}

In "The Festival of Sunflower" (Translation is mine. It's titled "ひまわりの祝祭" in Japanese) which is one of my favorite mystery book by Iori Fujiwara, main character had always build his canvas from a plywood in his high school.

He paint it white, torch it, make it flat and paint it white again. He does this several times to build his canvas.
I'm no artist. I've never done any oil painting, but I can empathize why he does this.

He said by doing this, he can produce interesting "matière".

The browser is not a canvas for me. HTML is.
The browser is a plywood.
I paint it white, torch it, make it flat and paint it white again. I do this several times.

Virga is based on [Hylia](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia).
Hylia has given me very solid foundation, so I only have to touch a few HTML.
