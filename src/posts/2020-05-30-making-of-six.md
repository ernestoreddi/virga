## Finding a new home for Sixty Six

@ 00:05 May 31, 2020{explanation}

I finally get to read ["Redesign: Clearing A Path"](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/redesign-wrapping-up/) by Frank Chimero. This post was the final note from his redesign journey.
Not only I love his design, I do also love what he writes. Reading these redesign notes got me think that it's time to find a new home for [Sixty Six](https://sixtysix.frontendweekly.tokyo/).

Virga was created for [Frontend Weekly Tokyo](https://frontendweekly.tokyo/). Not for Sixty Six. Moreover, Sixty Six is in an unique territory since it collects quotes.

That is why I'll create a new theme "Six" for Sixty Six. (I like naming stuff. Well, "Six" is not that difficult to come up, but I like it anyway.)

And this is where my journey begins.

This is a story about creating a theme for Eleventy, and I'll do it on open as Frank Chimero has done.

As always I don't know how this story going to end, but I'll document what happened to me along the way.

Notice the time stamp right after the header?
I think this journey will be long one, so I'm going to write this story open as well which means when I finished writing an "update", I'll upload it.
The time stamp indicates when I stop writing.
